    <p class="rText">This app tracks and makes analyses of your logs. You can either generate your daily goals based on your paramaters or you can set them manually under My Goals.
        <br><br>The goals are how many calories you need to consume and burn per day. 
        <br><br>You will need to enter a log each day with the calories you burnt(You can get this info if you use a device like FitBit), consumed(Self reported thru a food tracking website like MyFitnessPall) and your body weight(Weigh yourself every morning same way). 
        <br><br>The app will calculate the difference between the goals and the enteted data and will give you the balance.
        The balance will either increase or decrease, depending if you stick to the goals. Even if the balance goes negative, you still can make it up in the future and get back on track.
        <br><br>I believe in the flexibility and the app will deliver the flexiblity in your fitness journey.</p>
